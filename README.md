GAME DESCRIPTION:

SYNDICATE 404: Hack the System. Own the Grid.
In a fractured digital world, four powerful factions battle for control of the global network. Choose your side, complete high-risk contracts, and become the ultimate hacker in the underground world of Syndicate 404.

 FOUR FACTIONS. ONE CYBER WAR.

Syndicate 404 – A rogue hacker collective fighting for freedom and control of the digital realm.
The Shield – Cybersecurity enforcers protecting the grid from chaos and criminal exploits.
Arasaka Corp – A megacorporation using power and technology to shape the future of the network.
The Hive – Anarchist disruptors who see the system as a game, thriving on chaos and destruction.
 HACK CONTRACTS. EARN CREDITS.
Take on cyber heists, infiltrate corporate firewalls, and decrypt classified intel to earn Credits, the standard currency used across the underground market. Spend them on upgrades, trading, and building your hacking rig.

 TORCOIN: THE CURRENCY OF THE ELITE
Beyond Credits lies Torcoin, the rare and encrypted currency earned through high-stakes hacks, faction operations, and black-market deals. It grants access to premium hardware, hidden exploits, and underground networks that ordinary hackers can’t reach.

 WRAITHCOIN: THE HOLY GRAIL OF HACKERS
Rare. Encrypted. Untraceable.
Wraithcoin is the ultra-rare currency, only obtainable through legendary contracts, secret events, and top-tier faction warfare. It unlocks game-breaking exploits, classified black-market gear, and world-altering digital weapons.

 THE GLOBAL NET: TRUST NO ONE
Chat, trade, and collaborate with hackers worldwide. Form alliances or betray rivals as you climb the ranks. In this world, information is power, but one wrong move could wipe you from the system forever.

 BUILD YOUR PERFECT HACKING RIG
Upgrade your cyberdeck with black market tech—from overclocked CPUs to stealth-optimized GPUs. Every part affects your hacking abilities, from brute-force speed to firewall evasion and deception tactics.

 THE RISK IS REAL
Every hack, every contract, every choice has consequences. Whether you play it safe or risk it all for Wraithcoin, remember—the system is always watching.

 Welcome to the digital battleground. Choose your faction. Welcome to Syndicate 404.
